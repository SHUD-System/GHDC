## What is the GHDC

The Global Hydrologic Data Cloud (GHDC)is to provide a rapid and reproducible hydrological model development in any watershed, any continent, or any country. The users provide the watershed boundary, GHDC will do the data retrieve, subset clipping, reprojection, spatial-temporal data pre-processing, and so forth. Then, the user will receive a download link for the watershed.

### License

We do not produce data, but process data for modelers. So the license and right belong to original data creators. The current datasets support Public Domain, that allows reprocess and redistribute the data.

## How to require a data service

1.  Provide the watershed boundary. The file is in ESRI Shapefile format. The shapefile (including the .shp, .dbf, .shx, .prj files) must be ziped in a .zip file, and uploaded to GHDC.
2.  Fill the form of parameters.
3.  Fill your email address, and submit your request.
4.  Check you email and click the confirm link in the email from GHDC. After your confirmation, the GHDC starts data processing.
5.  After GHDC data processing, you will received the second email, which includes a download link. Please download the data within 14 days.
6.  Enjoy your data and modeling journey.
